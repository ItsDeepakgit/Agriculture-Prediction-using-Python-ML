# Agriculture-Prediction-using-Python-ML
Agriculture Prediction model or Machine Learning model in python that suggests the farmer to which crops to grown based on soil composition, PH level, rainfall etc.
## Objective
1. To implement prediction of agriculture crops.
2. To Solve the problem by proposing a prediction system through an ensemble model with majority voting technique crop for the specific parameters with high accuracy.
3. To recommend fertilizer on the basis of N, P, K values and crop.
## Definition
	Productivity needs to be increased. So that farmers can get more pay from the same piece of land without degrading soil.
	Indian farmers aren’t able to choose the right crop based on their soil requirements depending upon factors like N, P, K, temperature, Humidity, rainfall, ph.
