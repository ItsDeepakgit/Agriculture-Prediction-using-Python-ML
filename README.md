# Agriculture-Prediction-using-Python-ML
Agriculture Prediction model or Machine Learning model in python that suggests the farmer to which crops to grown based on soil composition, PH level, rainfall etc.
## Objective
1. To implement prediction of agriculture crops.
2. To Solve the problem by proposing a prediction system through an ensemble model with majority voting technique crop for the specific parameters with high accuracy.
3. To recommend fertilizer on the basis of N, P, K values and crop.
## Definition
Productivity needs to be increased. So that farmers can get more pay from the same piece of land without degrading soil. Indian farmers arenâ€™t able to choose the right crop based on their soil requirements depending upon factors like N, P, K, temperature, Humidity, rainfall, ph.
## Variable Details
1.	N (Nitrogen): ratio of Nitrogen content in soil. Nitrogen is really important for plant growth, plat food processing, and the creation of chlorophyll.
2.	P (Phosphorus): ration of Phosphorus content in soil. Phosphorus primary role in a plant is to store and transfer energy produced by photosynthesis for use growth.
3.	K (Potassium): ration of Potassium content in soil. It is an essential nutrient for plant growth.
4.	Temperature: In degree Celsius. High temperature affect plant growth in numerous ways. The most obvious are the effects of heat on photosynthesis, in which plants use carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and respiration.
5.	Humidity: relative humidity in %. When conditions are too humid, it may promote the growth of mold and bacteria that cause plants to die and crops to fail, as well as conditions like root or crown rot.
6.	PH: Ph values of the soil. Plant nutrients leach from the soil much faster at PH values below 5.5 than from soils within the 5.5 to 7.0 range.
7.	Rainfall: rainfall in mm. Plants use the moisture in the soil to replenish the water lost through transposition. Rainwater builds up the moisture levels in the soil and assures a healthy plant.
8.	Label: names of different crops.22 different crops and they are exploratory data analysis carried out to fetch insights from the data.
